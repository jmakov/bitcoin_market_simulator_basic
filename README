A basic framework for analysing energy flows between agents is provided enabling analysis and simulation of agent
behaviour and construction of strategies. Resulting data can be interactively analysed using SageMath. The corresponding
template code is in the 'analysis' folder.

First the database must be constructed. Free data is provided by bitcoincharts.com. 'build_database' creates the
database and logs events to the folder 'logs'.
To simulate agent responses run 'simulate_agent_responses' which creates corresponding database in your database
folder.
For visual data exploration basic interactive example is provided in the 'analysis' folder. SageMath (www.sagemath.org)
is required to run the interactive script.
